"""
Hillary Elrick, August 7th, 2019

Accepts a dictionary of potential guides and their off-targets along with the rgen ID for the guide. Determines which scoring method(s) to apply
depending on the rgen and appends each off-target with its score. Also adds the cumulative scores to the guide record in the dictionaries.

The code to calculate the CFD score (for Cas9 RGEN) is contained within the cfd_code folder and comes directly from the authors' paper.
